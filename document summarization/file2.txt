dismissing criticism of australia’s preparations and the make-up of the squad, steve smith said it had been in the execution of their skills that the players had fallen short.“you have to try and find your best 15, particularly in these conditions, and i think we had the right 15, we just let ourselves down in key moments,” he told reporters in his post-match news conference.“obviously we haven’t done as well as we’d have liked in this format but hopefully we’ll continue to improve.”  the “conditions”, slow pitches which favour spin bowling, were a recurring theme throughout smith’s postmortem of the campaign but it was the batting in the middle overs that he pinpointed.“we probably let ourselves down in the middle overs again ... losing a few wickets in clumps, not being able to get that partnerships together to get the score above par to 170-odd, so that was a bit disappointing,” smith added.“but i think the players will learn a lot from this tournament, playing in these conditions again, it’s very valuable and hopefully we can continue to learn and get better.”published in dawn, march 29th, 2016very classy of smith and the australian media to not harp on smiths wrong dismissal.the guy has a body fat of less than 8 per cent.“they [pakistanis] should work on their fielding aspects and their attitude to every aspect of their game,” added the islamabad united coach.jones said that pakistani cricketers need to take care of their bodies and consider it as ‘their temple’.the cricketer-turned commentator believed that turning to consulting coaches was not enough for the pakistan players to rectify the problems they face during their career.“these boys cannot just rely on the likes of wasim akram or myself, or other coaches telling them what to do, they need to sit down and work it out for themselves,” he said.“i don't believe too many pakistani cricketers are athletes.”jones, who unsuccessfully applied for the pakistan head coach position which was later filled by south african mickey arthur, was confident that the pakistan bowlers will dominate in their upcoming four-match test series against england.however, the 55-year-old believed that blunders in the slip cordon can frustrate pakistan like it did during the 2010 tour.“i think the pakistani bowlers will do very well but they need the support of the slip fielders and that could be a problem,” said jones.for jones, the experience of misbah-ul-haq and younis khan in the middle of a vulnerable pakistan batting line will be a crucial factor.“the pakistani batsmen will need to play the ball late and will be relying heavily on younis khan and misbah-ul-haq to get the runs and it could be a very interesting series if one of the veterans for pakistan has a good series with the bat,” he said.pakistan take on england in the first test match set to be played at lord’s in london from july 14. mohali: australian commentators were on monday full of praise for virat kohli’s thrilling batting.“steve smith called it the ‘virat show’ and he was right,” wrote chris barratt in the sydney morning herald, acknowledging the dejected skipper’s post-match remarks.“with one of the greatest ever twenty20 international innings india’s batting maestro all but single-handedly sent australia home from the 20-overs world championship.”“one man wins it,” agreed the daily telegraph’s ben horne as he described the match which crushed australia’s hopes of a world t20 title and puts india through to the semi-finals.“i think it’s safe to say there is no talent in world cricket at the moment quite like virat kohli,” horne said in a podcast.writing in the australian newspaper, gideon haigh said kohli’s unbeaten 82 off 51 balls had “made an awkward chase look like simplicity itself”.“not a stroke, by the way, would have looked out of place in a test match,” he wrote.“much as the marketers would like to take the cricket out of t20, kohli keeps putting it back.”while geoff lemon, writing for the australian broadcasting corporation said it was hard to feel disappointed at being knocked out by such an impressive innings.“it is hard to feel anything but awe,” he wrote.cricketing greats also heaped praise on kohli.“wow, that was absolute class from virat. former australia batsman dean jones has urged pakistan cricketers to follow indian ace batsman virat kohli’s example if they aim to put up consistent performances for their country.kohli has been india’s standout performer since his debut in 2008 and has played match-winning knocks on numerous occasions.the right hander is also one of the fittest athletes around and has drawn comparisons with the likes of tennis star novak djokovic by his trainers as far as fitness is concerned.“kohli is the level that the pakistani cricketers like azhar ali and asad shafiq need to get to,” said jones in an interview to pakpassion.net.“just look at the example of virat kohli.the answer is no.brother srinath kohli is a great batsman and hopefully he will perform well in next england tour i am looking forward to it but i like the way he dominates in odi and t20s @srinath@omar hayat exactly bro, looking forward too.... cheers.. (y)@omar hayat i remember kohli once thrashed malinga, the great in swinger, 24 runs in an over.kohli is one of the fittest man in the world of sportslooks like some here cant simply digest the fact that pakistan will take ages to produce cricketers who can be fit.
